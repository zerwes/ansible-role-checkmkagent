# Notes on using *dicts* for defining lists:
# As ansible is not merging lists, we use dicts
# to define lists.
# Only the values of the dict will be used.
# This way you can merge the settings for different
# environments.
# Example:
# basic settings
# check_mk_XXX:
#   all:
#     - aa
#     - ab
#     - ac
# and then for group x:
# check_mk_XXX:
#   x: xx
#   y: yy
# resulting in a list per host:
#   - "aa"
#   - "ab"
#   - "ac"
#   - "xx"
#   - "yy"
#
# using the old list format will still work

# define the hostname of the checkmk server
# required for fetching the deb package fron the server
# the server must be reacheble from the control machine, not from the target host
# checkmk_hostname:

# protocoll used by the server (http|https)
checkmk_proto: http

# IP of the checkmk server
# required for limiting the access to the agent via xinetd,
# as it will be added to the 'only_from' xinetd config line.
# configure this to your needs!
checkmk_ip: 127.0.0.1

# path part of the uri to get the agents from the checkmk server
# mostli SITENAME/check_mk/agents
checkmk_path: "SITENAME/check_mk/agents"

# optionaly define a hardcoded version of the agent in order to prevent upgrades
# if this is not set, we will detect the lates version from the server
# checkmk_agent_version: "2.0.0p4"

# agent name template
